Separate metrics are calculated for public institutions and private institutions. For public institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). For academic-year institutions, net price represents an average of all programs and includes only full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled in the fall term. For non-academic-year institutions (program or continuous enrollment), net price represents the program with the largest enrollment at the institution and it includes full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who first enrolled at any time during the academic year. For programs less than 1 year in length (see LProgram), this represents the net price for the full program. This metric is not available prior to the 2009-10 academic year."

The total cost of attendance depends on whether full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family). Income categories are calculated from the income values used by the institution to calculate financial aid eligibility. For a dependent student, this includes the student's and the parents' income.

PCTPELL: 
Percentage of undergraduates who receive a Pell Grant,aid,pell_grant_rate,float,PCTPELL,,,IPEDS,"Shown/used on consumer website;    The proportion of undergraduates who received a Pell grant in the academic year, calculated from the IPEDS Student Financial Aid component. This metric is calculated by IPEDS as the quotient of the number of Pell grant recipients divided by the count of all undergraduates for either a fall enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow an academic year calendar system) or a full-year enrollment cohort (for institutions that primarily follow a continuous enrollment or program-based calendar system). Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent. This metric is not available prior to the 2008-09 academic year."

Separate metrics are calculated for 4-year institutions and less-than-4-year institutions. The retention rate is calculated as the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year that are enrolled in the fall term of the current academic year divided by the number of full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates enrolled in the fall of the prior academic year. For 4-year institutions, this metric is limited to full-time, first-time, bachelor's or quivalent degree-seeking undergraduate students. For less-than-4-year institutions, this metric applies to all full-time, first-time, degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students. This metric is not available prior to the 2004-05 academic year. Proportions are expressed as decimals rounded to four decimal places, so, for example, 0.1234 equals 12.34 percent."
